//This .h file contains information on program 3.
//The program allows the user to enter questions and relevant information (e.g. question num, type, etc.).
//Question info is stored in an array of a question-type.
//Questions can be stored in a new text file or a previously existing one, if it has the name "practice.txt".
//Questions can be loaded from a previously existing text file.

//struct question
//{
//      int questionNumber;
//      char complete[SIZE], questionType[SIZE], questionText[TEXT];
